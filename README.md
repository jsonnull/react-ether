# react-ether [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsonnull/react-ether.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsonnull/react-ether)
A React scene graph and renderer for WebGL scenes.

* **Minimal** - Batteries _not_ included. Have the flexibility to write WebGL or pull in third-party resources.
* **Declarative** - Encapsulate rendering statements in reusable components and build up scenes declaratively. _Coming soon: native (`<lowercase>`) components to declaratively set WebGL state where it makes sense._
* **Performant** - You can use React's intelligent update reconciliation to manage the scene without touching it during animation frames.
